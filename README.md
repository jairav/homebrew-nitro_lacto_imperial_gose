# One Beer to Rule Them All

This repository is a custom Homebrew tap that installs applications and their
configuration. The goal is to keep all workstation setup in a single tap. At
the moment only Warp is supported.

## Usage

```bash
brew tap username/nitro_lacto_imperial_gose https://github.com/username/nitro_lacto_imperial_gose
brew install --cask warp
```

Installing the cask will copy the configuration files from `config/warp` into
`~/Library/Application Support/Warp` after Warp is installed.
